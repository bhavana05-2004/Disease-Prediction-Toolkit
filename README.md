# Disease-Prediction-Toolkit
ML project to predict diseases using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

ðŸ©º Disease Predictor using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning-based Disease Prediction System built in Python (Jupyter/Google Colab).
It uses health-related features (symptoms, medical parameters, etc.) to predict possible diseases with the help of classification algorithms.

The model can assist in early detection of diseases and provide useful insights for healthcare applications.

ðŸš€ Features
Preprocessing of healthcare data
Training ML models for disease prediction
Evaluation with Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
Easy to run in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
